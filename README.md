WebTwitter
========================
 
 
Implement a web-based social networking application (similar to Twitter) satisfying the scenarios below.
 
<h2>Scenarios</h2>
 
<h3>View timeline messages</h3>
 
* Once the main view is accessed, the aggregated list of all messages from users we follow will be displayed.
* When selecting one of the following users, the timeline should only show posts from that user.
* Again, if no follower is selected, it should show the aggregated message list of all the users you follow.

<h3>Posting a message</h3>
 
* As a user we should be able to add new messages to the timeline

<h3>Following/Unfollowing a user</h3>
 
* As a user we should be able to follow or unfollow a user.

<h2>What we are looking for: </h2>
 
* Pay attention about how your code is organized. Es importante que el dominio de la aplicación esté reflejado en el código.
* We love reusable and scalable code. This is the reason why we pay attention to the separation of concerns between the UI and the business logic.
* We would love to see the usage of the Software Design Patterns, SOLID principles and Clean Architectures.
* You are not intended to be proven as a designer. The provided mockups are just a guideline, feel free to build whatever you want using a component's library in order to help you to build the UI.
* We are not fanboys of frameworks/libraries but keep in mind that our front-end stack is based on React.
* We love clean code.
* We don't think 100% of code coverage is a must, but we love tests.
* We are looking forward to seeing your code and discussing your solution with you.
 
 
**NOTE**: Please it is important that you add instructions about how to run the application.
